## 🎯 Supported Instruments

The dashboard works with ANY Yahoo Finance symbol:

- **Commodities**: GC=F (Gold), SI=F (Silver), CL=F (Oil)
- **Forex**: EURUSD=X, GBPUSD=X, JPYUSD=X

- **Crypto**: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD
- **Stocks**: AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, etc.

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

The trading strategy uses a **weighted multi-indicator approach**:

1. **Trend Analysis (Weight: 1.5x)**
   - SMA crossovers
   - EMA alignment
   - Price position vs moving averages

2. **Momentum Analysis (Weight: 2.0x)** - Most Important!
   - RSI (oversold/overbought)
   - MACD crossovers
   - Stochastic oscillator
   - CCI, Williams %R, MFI

3. **Volatility Analysis (Weight: 1.0x)**
   - Bollinger Bands position
   - ATR for context

4. **Volume Analysis (Weight: 1.2x)**
   - OBV trends
   - Volume spikes
   - VWAP position

5. **Strength Analysis (Weight: 1.0x)**
   - ADX trend strength
   - Directional indicators

**Signal Generation**:
- Score > 5 → BUY 🟢
- Score < -5 → SELL 🔴
- Score between -5 and 5 → HOLD 🟡

**Confidence**: Based on alignment of all indicators (0-100%)
